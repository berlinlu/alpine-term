# Alpine Term

Alpine Term is a terminal and Linux environment application for Android.
A key difference of other terminal applications is that it uses
[Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) running inside the headless
x86_64 machine emulated with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/). Interaction
with the operating system is done through terminals which are attached to
the serial consoles of the virtual machine.
